# Step#1 -Create a bucket in Amazon S3

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f36d0b6d-8764-470f-a18e-bec777bdc41d)

- On the general purpose buckets click (Create Bucket)
- Create your bucket name 
  * An S3 bucket name is globally unique. After you create a bucket, no other AWS account in the entire world can use your bucket's name (unless you delete the bucket).
    This also means that when you create your bucket, you need to make sure the bucket's name is unique too.

- For Object Ownership, choose ACLs enabled.

what are ACLs (Access Control Lists)?

An ACL = a set of rules that decides who can get access to a resource.
Enabling ACLs in this S3 setup lets you control who can access and do things with the objects (i.e. website files) you upload into your bucket.
With ACLs, different AWS accounts can own and control different files in your bucket.
- Choose Bucket owner preferred.

- For Block Public Access settings for this bucket, clear the check box for Block all public access.
  * This banner is telling us that the bucket and its objects might become public if we untick the checkbox. This is what we want to host a public website.
  * Check the box that says “I acknowledge that the current settings might result in this bucket and the objects within becoming public.”

# Step#4 -Make objects in your S3 bucket public
  In this step, we gonna setup our bucket into the public so the html we uploaded will be accessible online.
- Go back to Bucket Object tab.

- Choose *Permission* .

- We gonna go to edit the bucket policy
  I made the json code for our bucket policy kindly check the uploaded json file here.

An AWS Bucket policy is a JSON document that defines the permissions and access controls for an Amazon S3 bucket. It determines who can access the bucket, what actions they can perform (e.g., read, write, delete), and under what conditions.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/407d5886-2e55-4aab-94f9-e2bbd9ca3adb)
- Copy the policy code and paste it into your bucket policy.
